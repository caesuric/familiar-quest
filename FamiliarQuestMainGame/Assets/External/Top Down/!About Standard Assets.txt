Readme
Standard Assets; the standard assets are free assets provided by Unity Technologies. 
They can be imported from the Assets/Import tab within Unity or from the Asset Store. 
The standard assets contain the basics of Unity with free speed trees, water, post processing effects and so on. 
When importing the standard assets it put them into 2 folders. Editor folder and Standard Assets folder.
 
In Our Packs at Manufactura K4 we have left the folder structure of the standard assets as default when you first 
import standard assets into your project. 
The reason for this is due to naming conventions and global name space errors caused due to multiple duplicates 
of these standard assets importing each of our Manufactura K4 packs you won't have these namespace errors 
when importing our packs. It is recommended that you leave the folder standard assets and editor folders 
where they are while you are doing the import process of your content. you can still move your standard 
assets folder around but it's highly recommended that the editor folder stays in the route of the assets folder 
otherwise errors in scripting compiles could occur. 
When importing one of Manufactura K4 packs be sure that during the select to import process you unchecked 
the editor folder and standard assets folder if you've moved your standard assets folder location.
